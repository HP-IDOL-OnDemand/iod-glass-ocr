=============


The repo contains 3 versions of the exampleÂ 

1. A Camera sample app, allowing you to take pictures using google glass.
2. A Camera sample app with Voice Command launch. Same as the first example but with the voice command already added to the code.
3. A Camera+OCR sample app: the final output of this tutorial. Being able to take photos and display the OCR result using IDOL OnDemand.
